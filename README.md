# Music Industry Data Mining and Customer Intelligence

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a digital music store database using SQL to extract meaningful business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and music preferences.

## Dataset
The database represents a digital music store and consists of multiple related tables, including:

- customer
- invoice
- invoice_line
- track
- album
- artist
- genre

The dataset structure is inspired by a publicly available SQL case study and was used for hands-on SQL analysis practice.

## Business Questions Answered
- Who are the top-selling artists in the music store?
- Which music genre is the most popular in each country?
- How much has each customer spent on different artists?
- Which artists have produced the highest number of Rock tracks?
- Which tracks are longer than the average track length?

## SQL Concepts Used
- INNER JOINs
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (RANK, PARTITION BY)
- Sorting and filtering

## Tools
- SQL
- GitHub

## Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of relational databases and improved my ability to write complex SQL queries for real-world analytical problems.
